# Mean-Time-Spent-in-Transient-States-in-a-Multi--Stage-Warehouse-System-using-Markov-chain
This project analyzes the mean time spent in transient states within a warehouse processing system,
focusing on optimizing logistics operations. The study applies Markov chain models to estimate
the duration items spend in different stages before reaching the absorbing dispatch state. By
leveraging synthetic data, including entry and exit times along with product IDs, we construct a
transition probability matrix to model the flow of products. The methodology incorporates the
fundamental matrix approach to compute expected time durations for sorting, quality checks, and
packing. This research aims to provide insights into warehouse efficiency, identify potential
bottlenecks, and enhance overall supply chain performance.
